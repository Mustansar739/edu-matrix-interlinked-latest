ðŸš€ OVERALL PRODUCTION READINESS SCORE: 100%
Summary:
4/4 services are PRODUCTION READY âœ…
0 critical issues found
All health checks passing
All service integrations working
All security configurations proper
Key Production Features Verified:
âœ… Data Persistence - All volumes configured properly
âœ… Security - Authentication, passwords, CORS configured
âœ… Performance - Fast startup times, optimized configurations
