## **🏛️ INSTITUTION DATA ISOLATION PLAN**

### **Multi-Tenant Architecture with Row-Level Isolation**

**Core Concept:** Each institution gets completely isolated data within the same database using `institution_id` filtering.

### **Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Institution Registration Flow:**
   - New institution submits application
   - System approves/rejects via `edu_matrix_hub_schema`
   - Approved institution receives unique `institution_id`
   - All institution data is isolated under this ID

2. **Data Isolation Method:**
   - **Every table in all 11 schemas** includes `institution_id` field
   - **Row-Level Security (RLS)** filters data by institution
   - **Complete data separation** between institutions

3. **Schema Structure Example:**
   ```prisma
   // Applied to ALL schemas (social, courses, jobs, etc.)
   model TableName {
     id            String @id @default(cuid())
     institution_id String  // 🔑 Data isolation key
     // ... other fields
     
     institution   Institution @relation(fields: [institution_id], references: [id])
   }
   ```

4. **Data Access Control:**
   - Institution A: Only sees data with `institution_id = "inst_A"`
   - Institution B: Only sees data with `institution_id = "inst_B"`
   - **Zero data leakage** between institutions

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Complete Data Privacy** between institutions
- ✅ **Scalable** to thousands of institutions
- ✅ **Centralized Management** via edu_matrix_hub_schema
- ✅ **Flexible** for future cross-institution features

**Note:** The `edu_matrix_hub_schema` serves as the central control system for institution management, registration, approval, and data coordination across all other schemas.
