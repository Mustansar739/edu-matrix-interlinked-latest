This project is very, very, and very complex.
The requirements demand deep and dive thinking and deep dive analyzations with reasoning.

You must follow these steps strictly, with full focus and justification at each stage:

1. First, analyze this prompt deeply.

2. Then, analyze it again with even more depth and reflection.

3. After that, create a proper and complete plan for how to fix or create  this.

4. Only after fully completing all thinking, analyzation, and planning — then and only then — you may begin implementation.

Every step must be followed with deep reasoning. No step can be skipped.
This is mandatory."
